I am an Associate Professor of Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Science, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Mali. Currently, my research focus on gaining insights into malaria parasite-host interactions and understanding mechanisms of malaria pathogenesis and malaria parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs. My work also includes study the genomic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2. I use genomics and bioinformatics as tools to address my research questions.

I teaching activities are focused on Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics. I teach Bioinformatics to master level students and molecular biology to pharmacy student.

Molecular biology courses
======
I teach molecular classes to Pharmacy students, Master level students at the Faculty of Pharmacy in Bamako as well as at the Université des Sciences de la Santé in Gabon. The course covers varieties of topics including introduction to molecular biology to advanced topics on molecular biology applied to parasites.
